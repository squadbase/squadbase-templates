# Squadbase Templates

A collection of production-ready templates for [Squadbase](https://www.squadbase.dev).

## Squadbase

Squadbase is a platform for Vibe Coding for Business Intelligence (BI). It enables you to build business dashboards simply by interacting with an AI agent. As a fully cloud-based solution, Squadbase requires no infrastructure setup—get started creating dashboards in just minutes.

While Squadbase comes with several built-in data connections, this repository offers not just connections but more practical and ready-to-use templates. These templates are pre-configured dashboards designed for real business use cases and can be used right away by simply switching the data connection.
